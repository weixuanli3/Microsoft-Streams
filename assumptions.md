Current assumptions for functions:

- Maximum passowrd length? (not implented yet)
    - At the moment we assume the user will not make anything overly long

- Assuming handle will always be of reasonable length due to number of ppl with the exact same name being low
    - (At the moment is susceptible to malicious users breaking the system by creating multiple of the same user)

- Somwthing should add later anout special characters
